To share your shiny new dashboard with the world, follow these steps:

1. Change the name of the html file to 'index.html'
2. create a github repository and ensure that you initialize it with a read.me file.
3. Once the repository is ready, rename the dashboard to 'index.html'. If you name it anything else,
it will not show up.
4. Once the dashboard is successfully uploaded, remove all content from the read.me file.(Do not
delete the file, it just needs to be empty)
5. Go to settings of your repository and enable github pages.
6. Visit the link of the newly created gihub page and your dashboard should appear!
